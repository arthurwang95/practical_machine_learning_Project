Dear my friend,

Please use Use the URL http://htmlpreview.github.io/ to convert a raw html file into the interpreted version, including any charts / graphics that were generated by knitr.

My html URL is following:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arthurwang95/practical_machine_learning_Project/master/ML.html

If you want to do a quick review, check the PDF file instead. It contains the exact same information as html file.

Thank you very much!

Arthur
